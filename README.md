# CMPSC 101 Midterm Information

## Introduction

The exam will be released at 3pm on Thursday, 8 October via GitHub. It will be due by midnight of October 9 2020\. There will not be new lab or practical assignments this week and the lab and practical sessions can be used to complete the exam and ask clarifying questions over the exam. The exam is estimated to take one hour to complete (assuming no time is taken to look things up). 

Following the process for lab assignments, you will be given a GitHub Classroom assignment link, you can then accept the assignment, clone the `midterm` repository, and find `midterm.md` file, which will contain the exam questions. You are invited to type your answers directly in this Markdown file. Continuous Integration will not be used in this repository. You should commit and push your work frequently. The last commit before the due time of midnight on October 9 will be graded.

The exam is open notes (hand written, typed, slides, programs, book). You are to abide by the college's Honor Code policy and the course's Code of Conduct while working on the exam. The answers will be checked for signs of plagiarism from the Internet.

The exam will cover all material up through Monday, October 5. Detailed information about the content that could be covered on the exam is provided in the [Study Guide](studyguide_exam01.pdf).
